# Tiago's Shelf of Treasures
## Introduction
Tiago's Shelf of Treasures is an app created in the Apple Developer Academy in order to introduce myself to my colleagues. It represents some of my personality traits, through games I love. 

## Development
The App was idealized first in Figma, where the design was created. There the screens were drawn and the assets that would be used as well. 
Then, I started delving into the programming and hit no major roadblocks, until I had to use the DragGesture and lock the positions of the cartridges, once they were fit into the correct spot. 
After that, the App flowed a lot better and it was easier to finish.

## Libraries/Frameworks
- SwiftUI
